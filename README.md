# **Sign-Language-to-Sentences**

A real-time sign language recognition system that converts hand gestures into meaningful sentences using deep learning and computer vision.

## **Features**
✅ Real-time sign language recognition using **MediaPipe** and **LSTM-based Deep Learning Model**  
✅ Converts sign gestures into readable text  
✅ Live video feed with overlaid predictions  
✅ Supports both **live camera input** and **pre-recorded videos**  
✅ Flask-based web interface for easy interaction
